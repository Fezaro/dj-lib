Note: Here we use all() to get all records (the default).
While you can use the filter() method to get a subset of records in code, you can't do this directly in templates because you can't specify arguments to functions.
Beware also that if you don't define an order (on your class-based view or model), you will also see errors from the development server.

To overcome the above:

    1. Add a ordering inside a class Meta declaration on your model.
    2. Add a queryset attribute in your custom class-based view, specifying a order_by().  #flexible
    3. Adding a get_queryset method to your custom class-based view and also specify the order_by(). #flexible
